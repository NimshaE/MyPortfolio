            <h3>Project Overview</h3>

            <p>
              As an Associate Software Engineer specializing in UI/UX, I worked on the FigaBooks project, which involved 
              designing and enhancing both user and admin platforms. The project spanned several phases, including logo 
              redesign, feature additions, branding guideline checks, and mobile development for a time-tracking system.
            </p>

            <h3>Logo Redesign</h3>

            <p>
              The project began with recreating the company logo to a flat design suitable for both the FigaBooks user and 
              admin platforms. This set the visual tone for the entire project.
            </p>

            <h3>Initial Design and Scope of Worky</h3>

            <p>
              I started by reviewing the existing designs before diving into new features and tabs. Our team discussed the 
              company requirements to understand the Scope of Work (SOW) clearly. The first major task was designing the 
              Quotation tab, ensuring it maintained consistency with the existing invoices page.
            </p>

            <h3>Feature Enhancements and New Tabs</h3>

            <p>
              To align with client requirements, I designed several new features and updated existing ones:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>GL Codes Selection: Added to the Chart of Account Expenses.</li>
              <li>Reports: Created Financial Report and GST/VAT report.</li>
              <li>Settings: Updated with four user types.</li>
              <li>New Fields: Added to the Create Account page, including BIC, business type, GST registration, and more.</li>
              <li>User Management: Added fields like company address, logo, and user types.</li>
              <li>Dashboard Enhancements: Introduced new matrices, Current ratio, and P/E graphs.</li>
              <li>Sales Invoices: Added GL codes, tax, and UOM input fields.</li>
              <li>Transactions Tab: Updated with an Upload Statement page.</li>
              <li>Reports: Added Provisional Tax Returns and GST Audit report.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Branding Guidelines and Development Feedback</h3>

            <p>
              I checked the staging version with developers to ensure adherence to branding guidelines and provided 
              feedback for adjustments.
            </p>

            <h3>Digital Presentation Portal Updates</h3>

            <h4>SOW-2: Package Pricing and Stripe Checkout</h4>
            <p>
              In the second scope, I focused on adding details for Package pricing and Stripe checkout for payments. 
              Given Stripe's built-in checkout pages, I designed mock-ups for the pricing page.
            </p>

            <h4>SOW-3: User Packages and Further Enhancements</h4>

            <p>
              The third scope revolved around FigaBooks User Packages. Key tasks included:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Mock-Up Designs: Payment Settings, Account Closure banner, Lockout mail, Account Retention mail.</li>
              <li>Updates: Transactions, Settings, Profile, Migration Settings, Journal report, minor PDF updates.</li>
              <li>User Role Enhancements: Accountant's workpaper module, Fixed Asset register, Manual Journals, Year-End Reports, and IRD report.</li>
              <li>General Changes: Invoices, Quotes, Customer, Supplier module, Bank statement upload.</li>
              <li>Admin Portal Enhancements: Customer and Business Subscription, Coupon module, email templates for new user, invoice/quote, verify user, and account delete.</li>
              <li>After each design phase, I demonstrated the updates to the client, incorporated their feedback, and then proceeded to development.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Post-Development Review and Support Centre</h3>

            <p>
              After development, I reviewed the staging version against mock-up designs to ensure accuracy. The client later requested a 
              Support Centre to assist users with a video library. I designed it as a hyperlink on the top nav bar, with each section 
              featuring an information icon linked to relevant video tutorials.
            </p>

            <h3>Final Updates and Demonstrations</h3>

            <p>
              The final tasks included redesigning the Advisor Login (New Digital SOA request) and the Presentation Upload page of the Statement of Advisor portal, 
              incorporating a history of previously completed digital SOA requests. These designs were updated according to feedback received during demonstration 
              sessions.
            </p>

            <h3>FigaBooks - Time Tracking (Mobile Development)</h3>

            <h4>Initial Client Requirements</h4>

            <p>
              The client required a time-tracking and attendance system for athletes. This involved creating two 
              sections: a desktop version for the Employer portal (Sports team) and a mobile version for Coaches and Athletes.
            </p>

            <h4>System Features</h4>

            <p>The system needed to:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Generate Reports: Daily, weekly, and yearly attendance.</li>
              <li>Create Accounts: Coaches could create accounts for athletes.</li>
              <li>Track Attendance: Athletes could log practice start time, end time, and break time via timesheets.</li>
              <li>Approval Process: Admins and coaches could confirm the information submitted by athletes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Wireframes and Mock-Ups</h3>

            <p>I started by creating wireframes for both desktop and mobile versions. The mock-ups adhered to the 
              existing FigaBooks design, ensuring consistency. These included:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Time Tracking: Timesheets and attendance reports.</li>
              <li>Workspace Management: Owners could create different workspaces for various sports.</li>
              <li>User Roles: Athletes as users, coaches handling the workspace, and heads of sports managing master accounts.
                Feedback and Finalization</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              After internal demonstrations and updates based on feedback, the design was finalized and presented to the 
              client for further feedback.
            </p>

            <p>
              The FigaBooks project showcased my ability to manage complex UI/UX design tasks, collaborate with development 
              teams, and respond to client needs effectively. This project enhanced my skills in designing consistent, 
              user-friendly interfaces across multiple platforms and functionalities.
